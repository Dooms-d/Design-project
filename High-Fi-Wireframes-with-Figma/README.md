# Lab 3: High-Fi Wireframes with Figma

## ENSE 271 - People-Centred Design - Laboratory

**University of Regina - Engineering and Applied Science - Software Systems Engineering**

---

## Project Overview

This assignment focuses on creating high-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes using Figma by recreating a professional UI design from Dribbble. High-fidelity wireframes incorporate design elements such as images, colors, fonts, and real content that will appear in the final product.
